The brewers pay a fee of 6 sts./brout. There seem to be two charges from 1788, the other being to pay off a debt of some sort it seems since it is not per brout but rather per head ie per brewery.<br>
From 1798 they pay 2 sts/brout and no more<br>
Year, ending 31 March so the year shown is the year in which the report ends. The 1816 report runs from 1 Jan. 1815-1 Oct. 1816. From then on the year ends at 30 Sept. of the year shown.<br>

In all cases with half vaten etc rounded down to the next lowest full number.<br>
There is no indication of the ratio of one measure to the next except the rates of charge which would make it 1 ton = 2 vats = 4 kinnen.<br>
At one point an oxhead is mentioned and that oxhoofd = 36 tonnen but only one ever got taxed, that in the 8th month of 1844.<br>

Assumed that all payments are in guilders.<br>
The figure for beer excise for 1672 and 1673 is reported for six months only so 
the figure reported in this table is double what is in the document ie double the 
no. in the accounts to get proxy for annual amount.<br>
The figures from 1750 on are not truly comparable since wine excise then includes wine, brandy and vinegar, beer is split into binnen and buiten gebrouwen beer so figures for 1750 to 1810 are not here but in gdcc2.<br>
1 = Wijnaccyns - from 1741 wynen, asynen en brandewynen<br>
2 = Bieraccyns - from 1680 this is the excise for beer, meel, en stoutcoorn ie all those together<br>
3 = Total income which I assume means total income for the town<br>

Report divides the town into two districts ie Backenes & Spaarne but only total reported here.<br>
Rates varied even within the same year suggesting different strengths of beer.<br>
As high as f7 in 1591 but down to f2/brout by 1596 & stayed at that until week of 7 June 1608 when lowered to f1/8/0 ie one guilder & eight stuivers but in the week of 6 Sept, 1608 it was back up to f2 and remained there to the end of this data run.<br>
The year begins on 1 April and ends on 30 March so week 52 is the last week in March of the year after the one listed eg 52 of 1595 is 22 - 30 March, 1596.<br>
The year creeps forwards so that 1606 has 53 weeks, the last one starting on 30 
March. That means that 1607 starts on 7 April, but 1608 on 5 April, 1609 on 4 April and 1610 on 3 April.<br>

Rekeningen van den bier-accijns, 1656-1700<br>
1 = quarter of a year<br>
2 = income from excise on Leidtse of Delfsch, in guilders to lowest full guilder; also called from 1664 Grote bieren; also called from 1687 burgers bieren though there does not seem to be any change of category; from 1684 this was charged at the rate of 10 sts./vat<br>
3 = Burgers bier van de vaantjesluyden, beginning with 1713, as with 3; 3 & 4 are categories of burgers bier<br>
4 = Gulders bier, as with 3; from 1670 called 3 guldens bier; gets zeros from the third quarter of 1678 and then disappears entirely from the record from 1680<br>
5 = Best Leytsh, as with 3; from 1684 charged at the rate of 18 sts./vat; called best Leydtsche from tappers from 1663 or Best Leydtsche tappers and from 1684 Leytse bieren tappers or tappers best Leydsche or Tappers Leytse bieren<br>
6 = Binnenlandsch, tappers, as with 3; from 1684 described as Tappers buyte bieren; charged at 18sts./vat - presumably it was always Holland beer not brewed in Leiden and sold by tappers
7 = Binnenlandsch, burgers, as with 3; from 1684 described as Burgers buyte bieren and charged at 10 sts./vat<br>
8 = Brewers drinkbier, in guilders to lowest full guilder as with 3,6,7<br>
9 = total for all beer excises, only reported through 1663; in addition to the excises shown there was an excise on English beer but that was virtually always zero so the sum of 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 would give a good estimate of 10. Similarly the return from excise on Mom & Jopen bier was also usually zero for the 18th, though listed separately.<br>
An annual figure is reported for the total from 1664 but that is not included here.<br>

Reported in pounds, schillings and groots - but given her only in whole pounds.<br>
In 1463, 1464, 1473 and 1474 the total income was not reckoned in each of those years.<br>
The figures reported for 1515 are for 1 January, 1514, to 30 April, 1515. So they are really the 1514 figures plus four months of 1515.<br>
The figures for 1519 are for the year 1 May 1518 to 31 July, 1519. After that date the runs from 1 August to 31 July.<br>
From 1549 the new excise on beer was collected by the Treasurer for fortifications and so no record was kept any more. From 1549 the same was true as with nieuw bieraccijns for the excise on wine and beer at Arnemuiden. <br>
The beer excise at Arnemuiden from 1536-1537 was called the Wine and beer excise te Arnemuiden. The new beer excise was on foreign beer at 12 gr./tonne for beer of 2 grooten/stoop value and above.<br> For beer of a value of less than 6 gr. Flemish per tonne. That is not exactly what the accounts say but that is the way it was to be.<br>
In 1565 the brandewijns excise starts and the income was very small. A similar excise started that year at Arnemuiden and the income was also very small.<br>

Prices for beer from St. John's Chapter (Sint Jan's) in Utrecht.<br>
Table 70 Beer: In 15th century accounts ind entries for beer drunk on festive days or handed out to workmen. Called cerevisia, huppe and koyten.<br>
Measured in bollen (bowls) also in quarten in later acounts. Also rarely amphora, another name for bol.<br>
Sometimes the name of the inn is mentioned where the beer was drunk (so the figures include all taxes)<br>
Prices are given in albi(=plakken) p. quart. and here are the quoted prices times 30.86.  After an extensive reading of the taxt to do with money it is not possible to find why the conversion was made at that rate.<br>
A check of the Posthumous notes might help but to get price in albi just divide by 30.86. There is inflation over the period so having a single multiplier seems odd, so looks like rate of silver/albus not consistent.<br>
Posthumus, xliv-xlv, says that at Utrecht in 1435 there were 36 albi/pound, up to 48 in 1438. From 1461 12 albi/stiver.<br>  
Holland pound (of 30 groats) was in 1389 31.36 gms. of Ag, 1434 25.91 gms of Ag, in 1453 24.56 gms. and 1490/91 23.11.<br>
